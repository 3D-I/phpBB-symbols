# phpBB-symbols
phpBB extension adding convenient way to insert symbols in posts and PMs

This extension adds a set of tabs (behind the normal smiley images) allowing common symbols to be easily added into posts.

The extension currently has Beta status, it is functional, and somewhat tested, but minor chages are expected after further testing.

Todo:  
* Nothing at present.
